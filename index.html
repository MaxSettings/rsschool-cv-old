        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="site-text">I have a goal to become a highly skilled frontend developer. Most of my knowledge in this
          area came from self-study. I like Web development and I have already managed to learn a lot of information and
          got a lot of practice, both during studying and during work. And now I continue to study in order to improve
          myself and use the most relevant technologies and practices.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>I have about a year of web development experience. Almost all this time I have been working
          in a small company that develop websites for state institutions. I know what semantic, responsive and
          cross-browser development is and I can work with layouts in Figma and Photoshop. I have experience writing
          basic JavaScript logic (such as creating sliders, modals, burger-menus), working in a React project, and
          building a project component library.
